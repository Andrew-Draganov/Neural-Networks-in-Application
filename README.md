# Neural-Networks-in-Application
A student-run course I taught at UVA for upper class computer science students.  Student run courses are only allowed to be one-credit, which means that there was little opportunity for discussing code.  Instead, the focus was on the mathematical foundation of neural networks and how the model can be extended to achieve desired results.

The course is split up into three sections:  

- The first consists of an introduction to machine learning and neural networks for four lectures.
- After this, specific types of neural networks are discussed.  
    - These are auto-encoders, Convolutional networks and Recurrent Networks/LSTMs.
- Finally, we discuss five papers that are important in the field.  The papers in order are:
    - AlexNet and ZFNet (both papers discussed in one lecture)
    - Dynamic Pooling and Unfolding Recursive Autoencoders for Paraphrase Detection
    - Pixel Recursive Super Resolution
    - Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search
  
The last lecture topic will be up to the students.  Options include GANs, future of deep learning, and genetic algorithms.
